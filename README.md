# PCRE Workshop

[LIVE](http://thomas.weinert.info/workshop-pcre/)

A talk with tasks for the attendees. It is a step by step introduction into PCRE with PHP.

I use a wireless keyboard to allow attendees to solve the tasks.
A secondary beamer allows to show the slides while the primary beamer shows the IDE.

Here is a repository at https://github.com/ThomasWeinert/workshop-pcre-tasks with branches for each task.

Feel free to fork the repository for your own talks or send me merge requests.
